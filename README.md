An open source implementation of a supermarket delivery system for the Irish market. (Released under LGPL. The GNU Lesser General Public License )

This is the Irish equivalent of the popular portal site mySupermarket.co.uk.


The micro-services for the server backend are written in Java and the customer Android app is written in Cordova AngularJS.

Java 1.7 or higher is recommended.

Background :
--------------
The project was written as a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) in 2015. Enterprise Ireland were approached for funding or backing, but I was informed that Enterprise Ireland only support Multi Nationals and not startups! However, due to some issues with Enterprise Ireland's funding decisoon mechanism, they backed another crowd from the Tallaght region in Dublin (I dont know if they have a software background). I was politely informed that I should study a certificate course in a Community College, next to Kevin Street Garda Station! (I have an honours degree in Computer Science from UCD, and with experience in a range of startups/blue chips). This was just the start of the attacks, for pursueing this project. 
It has now been decided to open source the MVP source code.


Implementation :
------------------
This is a fully useable webapp, Android app and micro-services backend system, with all the basic features to start an aggregate supermarket delivery business. The core part of the system is the supershop-price-engine module, which is an object oriented framework for managing the data analyzers from each of the various supermarket plugins.


Deployment :
