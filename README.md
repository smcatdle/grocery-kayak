An open source implementation of a supermarket delivery system for the Irish market. (Released under LGPL. The GNU Lesser General Public License )

The micro-services for the server backend are written in Java and the customer Android app is written in Cordova AngularJS.

Java 1.7 or higher is recommended.

The project was written as a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) in 2015. However, due to issues with Enterprise Ireland deciding to fund and back another group of people located in Tallaght, it has been decided to open source the MVP.

This is a fully useable webapp, Android app and micro-services backend system, with all the basic features to start an aggregate supermarket delivery business. The core part of the system is the supershop-price-engine module, which is an object oriented framework for managing the data analyzers from each of the various supermarket plugins.

Anybody interested in contributing to a future system with Neural Network Algorithms and Kubernetes system, contact me at the address provided.

Business opportunities and discussions regarding this project are welcome.
