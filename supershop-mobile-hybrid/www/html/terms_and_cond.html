            A lot of the functionality of the Supermarket Service and the Website/App is about viewing alternatives 
            across different Supermarkets and/or within the same Supermarket. In
            fact, this happens in a variety of different ways all over the Supermarket Service
            and throughout different places in the Website/App. When we compare products and services
            (whether across different Supermarkets or within the same Supermarket), although
            we try our best to compare any products and services (such as comparing guide prices,
            Specific Health Information, etc.) honestly and fairly, we are dependent on data
            sourced from outside ourselves. Some of this data might, for example, come from
            "back of pack" information or information obtained from the Supermarkets themselves
            or from information provided by, or derived from, the National Health Service or
            the Food Standards Agency. <b>We do not warrant and we exclude all liability in respect
                of the accuracy, completeness, fitness for purpose or legality of any information
                accessed using the Supermarket Service or accessed via the Website/App or otherwise

            for purpose or legality of information relating to a Supermarket or information
            as to products or services (including Specific Health Information) shall rest with
            the source of that information, such as a Supermarket (or manufacturer, if that
            information is sourced from a manufacturer, such as that on 'back of pack') and
            that ultimately if you buy from a Supermarket or decide to buy certain products
            or services rather than others (or at all), the responsibility for doing so is yours
            alone.

            The Supermarket Service may allow you to "split" your Baskets between various Supermarkets.
            In other words, the presentation of items within a Basket may be split so some items
            are presented as being from one particular Supermarket and other items are presented
            as being from other different particular Supermarkets. In addition, the Supermarket
            Service may indicate that "splitting" a Basket between various Supermarkets may
            result in certain savings. <b>Please note that we do not warrant (and we take no responsibility
                whatsoever) regarding any projected savings that the Supermarket Service may indicate
                as resulting from a "split" Basket because all such indicated savings are the result
                of algorithms intended to compare products and services based on a number of factors.
                As such, any savings indicated are just that &ndash; indications, which are provided for
                your information only "as is" and which may or may not actually result in such savings.</b>
            Also, any indicated savings may not account for duplicate fees resulting from such
            a split (e.g. additional delivery fees). As always, you should review the contents
            of any Baskets before you transact with any Supermarkets - and you (rather than
            us) are always responsible for such transactions.

            We identify the alternative offerings and replacements in Clause 4.18 using algorithms
            intended to offer an honest comparison based on a number of factors related to each
            of the products, so that you get a close match to the items you had originally selected.
            We try to exclude subjective factors and subjective views where we can, so as to
            operate in accordance with honest practices and to retain our impartiality to always
            offer an impartial alternative. However, although we operate in this manner, you
            may disagree with our alternative offerings and replacements for a variety of reasons,
            not least because in the real world, some people (including you!) may have subjective
            views. For example, you may always prefer one particular brand of cola to another
            brand of cola; or one make of ice cream to another make of ice cream &ndash; in which
            case you will not be happy with our alternative offerings and replacements. However,
            we assume for the purpose of offering alternative offerings and replacements that
            no such personal preferences exist (unless you have personalised your use of the
            Service or the Supermarket Service to take account of your personal preferences).
            And so for example (absent any such personalisation by you):
