        <h3>About our site</h3>
        
        <p>
        Grocery Kayak is a different type of supermarket&mdash;one that allows you to view alternative products and shop online from the main Irish retailers all in one place. Our aim is to help you save time and money whilst giving you the best possible online shopping experience.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        It's up to you how you use our site: You can order your basket online, print your basket as a shopping list to take it with you to your local supermarket or simply just see alternative supermarket prices online. 
        </p>
        <p>
        We also help you find the best online deals and vouchers, as well as provide you with exclusive special offers only available to Grocery Kayak users. While you shop, we suggest alternatives in your basket in all the retailers so we can suggest smart swaps and replacements to help you save even more money. When comparing between stores, our only aim is to ensure that our shoppers get the best value checkout possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        To do all of this, we use cookies.  Cookies allow you to put items into your basket, move from shelf to shelf and department to department and stay logged in so you don't have to keep filling up your basket.  Without these cookies, you would not be able to take advantage of our Service.  
        </p>
        <p>We also use third party performance, functionality and advertising cookies which are not integral to the Service.</p>
        <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
        
        <p>
       Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device. 
        </p>

        <p>
     Cookies do lots of different jobs&mdash;everything from allowing you to move from page to page in a website and remembering your preferences to supporting the placement of a relevant advertisement.  When you visit Grocery Kayak various cookies may be placed on your device. Some of these are essential; our website will simply not work without them.  Others are not integral to the service. 
        </p>

        <p>
        We’ve provided more details about different types of cookies, how we and our partners use them and how you can manage your cookie choices below.  In addition, you can learn more about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org  and www.youronlinechoices.eu.
        </p>
        <h3>What types of cookies we use and how we use them</h3>
        <p>
          There are five main types of cookies.  A description of the different types and how Grocery Kayak and its third party partners use each one appears below.  For a list of the specific cookies used, links to additional information and information as to how to manage your cookie choices, please see the <span onclick="MspScrollTo('ManagingYourCookies')" class="AnchorLink">"Managing Your Cookies"</span>-section. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <span class="BoldHeadline"> Strictly Necessary:</span> These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website/App or the Browser Extension  and use their features. Without these cookies, most of the Services simply will not work. Grocery Kayak uses strictly necessary cookies to identify you and your device when you log in and then track and continue to "remember" you as you use the Service. This in turn allows you to do things like:
        
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              	Move around from page to page within the site without having to log in again at every page
            </li>
            <li>
               	Put lots of items in your basket from a variety of different shelves and pages without having to start over at every page
            </li>
            <li>
				Send your basket on to a Supermarket 
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay logged in to Grocery Kayak so that you don’t have to log in each time you visit
            </li>
          
        </ul>

        <p>
        <span class="BoldHeadline"> Performance:</span> These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works. Grocery Kayak uses performance cookies for the Website/App and Brower Extension to do things like: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Collect statistical information about our site. For example, we might want to know how many visitors there were in any given day or how many pages the average person views.</li>
             <li>	To understand how people use our site to help us make the site better.  For example, if we were to see that most users go right to the biscuits page after buying milk, we might add a direct link to the biscuits page from the dairy product page.  </li> 
             <li>	To see how well our website /App and Browser Extension are working and what parts could use some improvement by keeping track of what features people use.</li>
             <li>	To collect information about how users arrive at Grocery Kayak and to identify users referred by third party websites and referrers under referral arrangements.  This also allows us to assess effectiveness of our widgets and other offsite applications.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        <span class="BoldHeadline"> Functionality:</span> These cookies are used to provide you with enhanced features, such as the ability to write a product review or to receive online customer support. These cookies may be placed by Grocery Kayak or by the third party service providers who help us to provide you with these enhanced services. The information these cookies collect is anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.  
        </p>
        <p>
        <span class="BoldHeadline">Targeting/ Advertising:</span> These cookies are used by third party service providers that we use to help us to manage the advertising campaigns on our site. These cookies allow them:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>	To limit the number of times you see any given advertisement; </li>
          <li>	To measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign; and </li>
          <li>	To present you with advertisements which are more relevant to you and your interests.   </li>
        </ul>
         <p>
         In addition, Grocery Kayak shares behavioural data with third party partners who use cookies to present you with advertisements on other sites based on your activity on Grocery Kayak or, alternatively, to present you with advertisements on Grocery Kayak based on your activity on other websites. 
         </p>
         <p>
         The presenting of advertisements based on your online activity or browsing habits is called "online behavioral advertising". You can learn more about online behavioural advertising on <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/</a>.  
         </p>
         <p>
            The cookies used by our third party partners to provide you with online behavioural advertising may contain a unique key that is able to distinguish your individual browsing habits or store a code that can be translated into to a set of browsing habits or preferences using information stored elsewhere. Although these cookies can track your visits around the web they do not contain any personal information and do not know who you are.  You can find links to the privacy policies of each of our third party advertising partners in the <span onclick="MspScrollTo('ManagingYourCookies')" class="AnchorLink">"Managing Your Cookies"</span> section, below, as well as links which will allow you to manage your cookie choices. You can learn more about what data Grocery Kayak collects and how Grocery Kayak uses and shares your data in our

        <h3>Other Third Party Cookies</h3>
        <p>
        In addition to cookies set by Grocery Kayak and our third party service providers and partners, cookies may be set by other third parties while visiting the Website.  For example, if you visit a page with content embedded from an advertising network, a video streaming service or another source (e.g. YouTube, Facebook) they may set their own cookies on your web browser. These anonymous cookies may be set by that third party to track the success of their application (that is, count how many times it has been used or viewed) or to customise their application to you. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="ManagingYourCookies">Managing your Cookies</h3>
        <p>
        Some cookies are essential for Grocery Kayak to function and others are not.  You always have the option to set your browser settings to reject all cookies.  You can <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">see here</a> for more information on how to adjust your browser settings.  If you do reject all cookies, however, our Website/App and Browser Extension will not work.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Please remember that if you choose to reject cookies from a specific company or via <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com">www.youronlinechoices.com</a> or another industry website, it only applies to the web browser on the device you are using. You will therefore need to follow the same process on every device you use or different web browser that you use to exercise the same choice.
