</p>
<h3> C.  How We Use the Information We Collect  </h3>

<p>
    We use the personal data we collect to provide the Service, to customise and improve your Grocery Kayak experience, to make your experience as enjoyable and efficient as possible and for commercial  purposes.
</p>
<h3>Use of Information to Provide the Service</h3>
<p>
    Certain information is required in order for the Service, or certain features of the Service, to operate.
</p>

<p>
    Here are some specific examples of information used to provide the Service.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Your email address and password allows us to recognise you when you return so that we can provide you with a faster service and a personal user account.
    </li>
    <li>	We use your IP address to prevent any spam, fraud or abuse of our site.  </li>>
    <li>	To facilitate your registration to a Supermarket, we may provide you with the ability to register for a relevant third party website of a Supermarket through the Website/App. If so, we may pre-populate certain fields in the registration form for that third party website for you. If we do so, it will be for fields for which we already hold your information, such as your name, postcode and email address. You always have the opportunity delete any fields that we pre-populate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Information to Customise and Improve the Grocery Kayak Experience  </h3>
<p>
    We want your shopping experience on Grocery Kayak to be as enjoyable as possible.  We will collect the data about your shopping activities and preferences to customise your account (in addition to how you customise it yourself) and to enable us to provide an efficient and user-friendly service.  We will  also use it to improve the quality of the site.
</p>
<p>Here are some specific examples of how we use your data: </p>

<ul>
    <li>
        We keep details of your favourites from any of the Supermarkets (if you have chosen to import them to your Grocery Kayak account), details of items you have added to favourites and details of previous Baskets you have ordered in your favourites list. This will allow you to shop more efficiently on future visits.
    </li>
    <li>	We keep a record of the contents of your Baskets between shopping sessions. This allows you to continue shopping sessions that you may have stopped midway with no need to add again all the items that you already placed in your Basket.</li>
    <li>	We keep a record of your preferences such as sorting order of items and the last shelf you bought from, so you don't need to reset these preferences every time you start shopping.
    <li>	Paying attention to how you use the Website/App help us to develop improvements to the Website/App and the Service.</li>
    <li>    We use information about your current location in order to provide you with information about Savvy Buys, Offers and Top Offers available at a certain Supermarket when you are at that Supermarket (for users of the App). You may opt out of this at any time by managing your smartphone location services settings.</li>
    <li>
        If you have been referred to us by a third-party website, we may keep a record of the website that referred you so that we may work out which websites refer more or less users to our
        Website/App. We may also have referral arrangements with certain third-party websites and referrers and we may use this data to fulfil obligations that we may have to these third-party websites or referrers.
    </li>
    <li>	We collect and track individual and aggregate information about shopping habits, products and service preferences and selections which users have made and the like.  We use this information for the personalisation or general improvement of the Service, but also for the purpose of business research.  You can see more about aggregate information below. </li>

</ul>
<h3>Use of Information for Commercial Purposes</h3>
<p>
    Grocery Kayak does not charge users for use of the website or App. We earn revenues (which allows us to keep the website/App online and totally free to our users) through advertising sales, including online behavioural advertising, and through the sale of business intelligence data.

</p>

<p>
    Here is how your information is used for this:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We use information about your activity on our site, including information about your current location when using the App, in order to present you with targeted advertising-that is, product information, offers and promotions that we think may be interesting to you and that you might like. Without targeting, you will still see advertisements; they are just less likely to be relevant.
    </li>
    <li>	We share information with certain carefully selected third party partners so that they can present you with advertisements and promotional offers that are relevant to you and your interests on other sites based on your activity on Grocery Kayak or, alternatively, to present you with advertisements on Grocery Kayak based on your activity on other websites. For more information on data sharing, please see the "Data Sharing" section. </li>
    <li>	We collect and may display or use for the purposes of marketing and advertising the Website/App, Service or ourselves, any testimonials you provide us with about the Website/App, the Service or ourselves - and we may append to the testimonial your first name (but not your surname) and general geographic location (e.g. City or locale). </li>

</ul>
<h3>Use of Your Email Address</h3>
<p>
    We use your email address to communicate with you.  Some of these are service emails and are so we can communicate with you about Website/App updates or your activity on the Website/App.  For instance, we may send you service emails:
</p>

<p>
    In addition, from time to time we may email you marketing emails with Website/App news and updates or details of sales offers or promotions.  These may be marketing for the Website/App itself or on behalf of third parties. We may also contact you for market research purposes, either for commercial purposes or so we can get feedback about the Website/App.
</p>


<h3>Aggregate Information</h3>

<p>
    Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual user identities have been removed and from which it is not possible to work out individual customer identities. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but all such information will be anonymised and no identifying information will be included in the resulting data.
</p>
<p>

    Aggregate data helps us to understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so that existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. We use and disclose anonymised aggregate information to provide other products and services, as well for the purposes of evaluating and improving our existing products and services. We also sell such aggregate information, both via our  <a href="https://my-grocerykayak.rhcloud.com">business insights website</a>  and through other channels.


</p>


<h3>D. Security Measures</h3>

<p>
    All of the information we collect about you is stored on our secure servers and will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. For example, we use secure encryption to hold passwords (e.g. the password allocated as part of the registration process - which may later be changed) or your login details for a Supermarket (if you authorise us to save this information).
</p>
<p>
    We may send your information internationally including to countries outside the European Economic Area.  While we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, some places outside of the EEA may not have adequate data protection laws at all or may offer differing levels of protection of personal information which are not as high as in the UK. By submitting your data to us, you acknowledge that provided we have used your data in the ways set out in this Privacy Policy, we cannot be held responsible for any use of your data by third parties who receive and process your data.

</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
